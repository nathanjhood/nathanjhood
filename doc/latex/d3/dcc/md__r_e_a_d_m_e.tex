\PBS\centering I am a software developer with a strong interest in system-\/level programming.    \\\cline{1-1}

\PBS\centering I am also a musician making Audio software plugins using a variety of languages and workflows, and have some background experience in web development.    \\\cline{1-1}

\PBS\centering In my personal work, I have developed an (un-\/)healthy interest in automating build systems for system-\/agnostic interoperabilities and cross-\/compiling routines, with an eye for driving continuous integration/deployment pipelines in modern software development and production workflows.    \\\cline{1-1}

\PBS\centering Here you will find public repos of my personal research and development of audio plugins using popular frameworks such as JUCE and my own DSP, and more recently; explorations in cross-\/compiling toolchain technologies (WSL, MSYS2, Min\+GW, etc) and popular buildsystems (CMake, Meson, Make, Autotools, etc); code bindings to families such as the Win32 API, Linux Standards Base and Unix Single Specification; and usage of the Component Object Model alongside the C and C++ standard libraries, which you may download, compile, use, and study for free (mostly MIT or GPL2/3).    \\\cline{1-1}

\item A large pot of coffee, forever in need of refilling.

\PBS\centering Much of my code as presented here is something of a personal archive, a series of breadcrumbs through a journey of pesonal development. I anticipate that my work might mostly be useful as study pieces for other learners on the same path. My projects are typically either something I needed for a specific reason, or something I needed to learn about. The codebase itself strives for a minimal dependency overhead, in favour of longer shelf-\/life, cross-\/environment stability, and cognitive load. I tend toward traditionalism over modernism, but consider myself flexible and emperically-\/minded. If you have any suggestions or questions, get in touch -\/ I love to chat code!    \\\cline{1-1}
