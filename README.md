| Hi! I'm Nathan (aka StoneyDSP). |
| [![Anurag's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=StoneyDSP)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats) |
| I am a software developer with a strong interest in system-level programming. |
| |
| I am also a musician making Audio software plugins using a variety of languages and workflows, and have some background experience in web development. |

| In my personal work, I have developed an (un-)healthy interest in automating build systems for system-agnostic interoperabilities and cross-compiling routines, with an eye for driving continuous integration/deployment pipelines in modern software development and production workflows. |

| Here you will find public repo's of my personal research and development of audio plugins, and more recently, explorations in web fullstack development, which you may download, compile, use, and study for free (mostly MIT or GPL3). |
| Currently on the workbench: |
| - <a href="https://github.com/StoneyDSP/MSYS2-toolchain.git">A CMake buildsystem and toolchain for (Msys2) MinGW/Cygwin-based C/C++ projects on Windows, inspired by microsoft vcpkg</a>. </br> - <a href="https://github.com/StoneyDSP/MSYS2-pacman.git">A piecewise conversion of Arch Linux Pacman package manager to the CMake build platform, for eventual usage with the above</a>. </br> - <a href="https://github.com/cmodules/cmodules">A study on bridging the gap between NodeJS-based application development and C/C++ code libraries</a>. </br> - A large pot of coffee, forever in need of refilling. |
