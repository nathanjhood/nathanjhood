| <p>Hi! I'm Nathan (aka <a href="https://github.com/StoneyDSP">StoneyDSP</a>).</p>  |
| :-: |
| <p>I am a software developer with a strong interest in system-level programming.</p> |

| <p>In my personal work, I have developed an interest in automating build systems for system-agnostic interoperabilities and cross-compiling routines, with an eye for driving continuous integration/deployment pipelines in modern software development and production workflows.</p> |

| <p>Here you will find public repos of my personal research and development of audio plugins using popular frameworks such as JUCE and my own DSP, and more recently; explorations in cross-compiling toolchain technologies (WSL, MSYS2, MinGW, etc) and popular buildsystems (CMake, Meson, Make, Autotools, etc); code bindings to families such as the Win32 API, Linux Standards Base and Unix Single Specification; and usage of the Component Object Model alongside the C and C++ standard libraries, which you may download, compile, use, and study for free (mostly MIT or GPL2/3).</p> |

| <p>Much of my code as presented here is something of a personal archive, a series of breadcrumbs through a journey of personal development. I anticipate that my work might mostly be useful as study pieces for other learners on the same path. My projects are typically either something I needed for a specific reason, or something I needed to learn about. The codebase itself strives for a minimal dependency overhead, in favour of longer shelf-life, cross-environment stability, and lower cognitive load. I tend toward traditionalism over modernism, but consider myself flexible and emperically-minded. If you have any suggestions or questions, get in touch - I love to chat code!</p>  |
