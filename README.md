### <p align="center">Hi! I'm Nathan (aka StoneyDSP). I'm also musician making Audio software plugins using a variety of languages and workflows.
</p>

<p align="center">In my personal work, I have developed an (un-)healthy interest in the latest in C/C++, HTML5, CSS3, ES6 and NodeJs-based development, utilizing a range of platforms (Windows 10/11, Ubuntu Linux, WSL, some MacOs), various tools and SDK's such as Typescript, Vue3 (sometimes nuxt), JUCE, iPlug2, and custom scripting in pursuit of clean, robust, and largely self-contained (or modular) future-proofed, multi-platform, multi-architecture API's that do small and useful things - often, purely just for my own achedemic purposes.
</p>

<p align="center">
<a href= "https://stoneydsp.github.io/index.html">Here you will find public repo's of my personal research and development of audio plugins, and more recently, explorations in web fullstack development, which you may download, compile, use, and study for free (mostly MIT or GPL3).</a>
