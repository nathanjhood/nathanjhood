| Hi! I'm Nathan (aka StoneyDSP).  |
| :-: |
| I am a software developer with a strong interest in system-level programming. |
| [![Anurag's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=StoneyDSP)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats) |
| I am also a musician making Audio software plugins using a variety of languages and workflows, and have some background experience in web development. |

| In my personal work, I have developed an (un-)healthy interest in automating build systems for system-agnostic interoperabilities and cross-compiling routines, with an eye for driving continuous integration/deployment pipelines in modern software development and production workflows. |

| Here you will find public repo's of my personal research and development of audio plugins, and more recently, explorations in web fullstack development, which you may download, compile, use, and study for free (mostly MIT or GPL3). |

| Much of my codebase strives for a minimal dependency overhead, in favour of longer shelf-life, cross-environment stability, and cognitive load. I tend toward traditionalism over modernism, but consider myself flexible and emperically-minded. If you have any suggestions or questions, get in touch - I love to chat code!  |
